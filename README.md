## Introduction
The Operon C++ genetic framework is a powerful tool for genetic programming and evolutionary algorithms. It provides a flexible and efficient implementation of genetic operators, fitness evaluation, and other essential components for evolutionary computations. This repository aims to make it easier for users to get started with Operon by providing Dockerfiles and instructions for setting up the framework in a virtualized environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can find installation instructions for your specific operating system on the Docker website: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PaperMonoid/operon-dockerfiles.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```
$ cd operon-dockerfiles
```

3. Build the Docker image (this process may take several minutes):
```
$ docker build buildx -t operon:v1 .
```

## Usage
To use Operon C++ genetic framework in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. List the available containers:

```
$ docker container ls -a
```


2. A: Open a bash shell of a new container:

```
$ docker run -it operon:v1 /bin/bash
```

2. B: Alternatively, you can open a bash shell of an already created container:

```
$ docker start -i <container-id> /bin/bash
```

<sup><sub>
**Note:** Before creating a new container, you may want to check if you already have a container with the necessary configuration (make sure to check if you already have a suitable container before creating a new one using the `docker container ls -a` command). Running multiple containers unnecessarily can consume disk space over time. If you have a suitable existing container, you can use the `docker start` command (mentioned in step 2.B) to open a bash shell in that container instead of creating a new one.
</sub></sup>

3. Inside the shell, you will find the compiled Operon files and executables inside the `result` directory at `/home/operon/result`. You can use these files as needed for your projects. If you want to exit the docker container shell, use the `exit` command.

4. You may remove containers using the following command
```
$ docker container rm <container-id>
```
